# brain-tumor-detection-project
Final Project Ironhack Data Analysis

MRI (Magnetic Resonance Image), best type for detection (more contrast)

Image processing goals:

* Scaling the image so that the brain fits in it in the same way for all the images
* Making the tumor as visible as possible (filters, high contrast...)

I think the tumors are more white because the MRI shows more white for areas with more cell density.

Final purpose: passing an image of a brain and detect if it has a tumor or not, even if the image has colors, the brain doesn't fit exactly...
